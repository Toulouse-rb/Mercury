# Mercury

Mercury is a git repository setup module. It's Sinatra app that wait for queries to create git repositories, setup the authorized_keys file, return the status of a specific repository and say if it's alive or not.

Mercury doesn't have much brain and all the data about repository creation (paths, names, etc...) must come from another app.
